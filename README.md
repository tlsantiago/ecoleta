Technologies used:

- Javascript;
- NodeJS;
- Nunjucks;
- HTML;
- CSS;

The idea was to develop a website with responsive pages. Each page would consist of:

- Home page, with a search button and a registration button;
- Registration page, with a form used to register a new collection point and POST that data into DB;
- Search results page, who would reflect DB table objects;
